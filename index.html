        <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>

        <p>
            Hey there! Welcome to my website! If you'd like to know anything about me, my projects, or my interests you can find it here. Besides being my internet domain, this is also where I practice my web design skills such as CSS and Javascript. As so, you can expect frequent updates. 
        </p>

        <h2>What can I find on this website?</h2>

        <p>
            As this website is essentially a playground for my development, you may find loads of different things, including blogs, tools, galleries, social links and maybe even games if I get talented enough. I'm relatively new to web design, so I'm really trying anything I can to improve my skills. If you've got an idea maybe we could try to add something together! 
        </p>

        <h2>Who are you?</h2>

        <p>
            I go by many names including Tony, Anthony, Lenny or really whatever someone feels like calling me. I've been using the world wide web since I was a kid, but only recently tried my hand in web design. I am the exclusive developer of everything you see on this site, and I'm completely self-taught using digital resources. You can learn more about me in my About Me page. 
        </p>

        <h2>Other?</h2>

        <p>Oh that's all, really! Please have fun, and don't go around looking for secrets.</p>
